# Project Euler Solutions #

These are my solutions to some of the programming problems at [http://projecteuler.net/](http://projecteuler.net/). I'm using these as a vehicle to:

 * learn the Scheme programming language
 * compare ease of solution across different languages
 * make use of my subway commute ;)

Most of the scheme programs were intended to be run with:

    tinyscheme problemX.scm

A few of them require bignum support and can be run with mzscheme.
